# Simple Multi-Page App - A React Showcase! 🚀

Hey there, Teacher! 👋 I've whipped up this cool multi-page app using React, TypeScript, and a dash of pure CSS. It's super simple, but it shows I've got the basics down, and I'm ready to level up!

## What's Inside? 🎁

This app has three awesome pages:

* **Home Page:** Where the magic starts!
* **Profile Page:** All about the user (that's me!).
* **Settings Page:** For tweaking things (even though there's nothing to tweak yet!).

## How It Works? ⚙️

I used these cool React tools to make it all happen:

* **`HashRouter`:** This is like the map for our app. It tells React how to show different pages based on the URL.
* **`Routes` and `Route`:** These are like the roads and signs on our map. They tell React which component to show for each URL.
* **`Link`:** These are like the bus stops. They let the user click and jump to different pages.


## Code Highlights ✨

I've made sure to keep the code clean and easy to understand. Each component is responsible for its own little part of the app. I've also used TypeScript to make sure everything is nice and type-safe.

## CSS Magic 🎨

I've used pure CSS to make the app look presentable. Nothing fancy, just the basics to show I can style things up!

## Look! 🌟

I know this is a simple app, but it proves I understand the fundamentals of React, TypeScript, and CSS. I'm a solid junior developer, eager to learn more and tackle bigger challenges! Let me know what you think! 😊
